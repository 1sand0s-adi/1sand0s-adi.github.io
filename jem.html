              <h4>Inspiration</h4>
              <p>JEM is an FEM solver written completely in Java without any 3rd party libraries. Everything, from meshing to heatmaps was coded from scratch.
             FEM(Finite Element Method) is a numerical technique for solving PDE's and ODE's when analytical approaches are not possible. In our case, this mostly
             concerns the Laplace and Poisson equations which help us to construct a potential surface when the boundary conditions are known.</p>
             <p>FEM was preceeded by two approaches, the Ritz method based on minimizing a functional and the Galerkin method based on minimizing the residual. Both
              employ a subdomain basis functions to represent the unknown solution and converge on it iteratively during the minimization process. In FEM, the surface 
              is first discretized by choosing the appropriate basis functions, in our case its the triangle for 2D and eventually tetrahedron for 3D primarily because
               tesselations created using these structures lead to the most minimal discretization errors hence are generally more accurate. Once the surface has been discretized,
               the potentials at the nodes of the triangle elements are used to fill in the FEM matrix (stiffness matrix) and these are hence used to compute the potential at any point within
                the triangle element. Consequently, smaller the triangles lesser is the inaccuracies due to interpolation. The interpolation is linear in the case of FEM and 
		     usually just involves a plane described by the potentials at the 3 nodes.</p>

                <p>Due to the inability of the arduino to switch the signal control transistors at a speed higher than a few milliseconds I resorted to use the   Raspberry Pi instead. This adds an extra PNP transistor since GPIO's are 3.3 V operational and not 5V therefore added the PNP as a buffer incase anything shoud go wrong which is very unlikely since the source of the signals are digital as well. This requires wiringPi by Gordon Henderson to be installed on the Raspberry Pi, a brief reveiw will reveal that GPIO's can switch at speeds between 4.1MHz-4.6MHz when operated with wiringPi C library which clocks in the nanosecond range which is perfect for switching the transistors.</p>

                <p>Link to wiringPi download and install : <a href="http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/">http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/</a></p>

                <p>Link to benchmarking RPi GPIO speed : <a href="http://codeandlife.com/2012/07/03/benchmarking-raspberry-pi-gpio-speed/">http://codeandlife.com/2012/07/03/benchmarking-raspberry-pi-gpio-speed/</a></p>

                <p>The pitest file uses 9 Transducers, right now it works only for 9 but with inclusion of Adafruit's PWM i2c driver this can be increased significantly to include as many as 992 transducers.</p>

                <p>The pin configs are as follows:</p>

                <pre><code>                            
                                                       (38)(07)(22)                   (28)(07)(06)
                                                       (18)(16)(15)                   (05)(04)(03)
                                                       (13)(12)(11)                   (02)(01)(00)
                                                          SET-A                         SET-B
               </code></pre>

                <p>Where the numbers of SET-A correspond to the physical pins of RPi's GPIOs and numbers of SET-B correspond to the wiringpi definition or numbering for those physical pins , either one can be used while coding the C file, but strictly adhere to the physical pin mapping (SET-A) when connecting the transducers to the RPI.</p>

                set, single chip microcontroller (μC) series which was developed by Intel in 1980 for use
                in embedded systems. Intel's original versions were popular in the 1980s and early 1990s and
                enhanced binary compatible derivatives remain popular today.
                The IC-8051 was preferred above all the other IC’s cause for generating two independent
                square waves simultaneously we required two timers and 8051 offers two timers and besides this
                it was the most inexpensive option for achieving this goal. The two square waves are generatd at specific frequencies
                as required by the carrier and modulating signals, these are then passed into a R-2R ladder network to obtain the desired
                waveform.The availability of two timers implies that ,while one can be monitored continuously the other is run in interrupt mode
                and is checked automatically when it interrupts due to overflow.When an interrupt occurs from either of the timers , the execution
                jumps to a vector table which contains code to transfer certain byte values to the specific ports corresponding the specific signals</p></p>

                <p> The Raspberry Pi is used as the processor for testing the module however the the board also possess many functionality which is not required
                by the porject and hence compromises efficiency and area, therefore once the testing phase checks in , the idea is to develope a breakout board 
                independent of serial comm module thereby greatly reducing chip power consumption and area. The intention is very much similar to that of 
                arduino pro mini. Therefore to program such a device, we would required serial to UART and hence make use of CP2102, this can also be made use
                of if the PC itself acts as the controller , in-charge of sending signals to the transducer array in which case the signal frequencies to be used 
                are sent to 8051 by the PC through CP2102

                  On moving the data from the accumulator to the output ports , there is a finite delay involved as a
                  result of this the voltage intermittently drops to 0v just before rising to its new potential. The 'mov' operation on an average takes about
                  1 Machine Cycle which on using a 24Mhz crystal approximates to 0.5us, Therefore there is a 0.5us delay during the transition from previous value
                  to new value and during this the port is in high impedance and hence the signal drops to zero intermittently</p>

                  Therefore the value assigned to the ports during the previous cycle is latched by the IC followed
                  by which it is disabled until the port acquires new value during the next cycle , therefore until the

                <p>
                  Since ATMEL's AT89C51 can work with a maximum crystal frequency of 24MHz the time per machine cycle will be around 
                  0.5us(micro second) which implies that since a complete sine wave will take about 25 individual values to be loaded to the port 
                  and each loading step taking an average of 15 machine cycles(7.5 microseconds) , the max frequency that can be generated will 
                  be around 5.3KHz . Therefore this will have to be increased atleast 10 fold for which we employ PLL(Phase locked loop) with 
                  divide by 10 counter to latch the output frequency to 1/10th of the input(source) frequency. 
                  The same applies for the low frequency which again is limited to 300Hz therefore requiring another frequency
                  division by atleast 10 fold.
                   During the initial loading of the signal values, they are produced under default configuration(40KHz and 200Hz) ,this is done
                  because ,since we are using PLL's to vary the frequency of the signal ,the PLL's have fixed capture range and significantly 
                  large tracking range and so once the input has been captured it can be tracked well beyond the optimum range of input 
                  frequency but since it encompasses a low pass filter ,therefore if the value input varies considerably from the configured
                  value then it may not be captured hence failing to work as a multiplier or divider, for this purpose the carrier initial
                  frequency is set to 40KHz and modulating signal initial frequency is set to 200Hz , these can be varied but only after the
                  device and code performs as expected for these inputs which imply that they have been captured and are being tracked.

                  of the PLL for multiplication or between LPF(Low pass filter output) and VCO for division. It basically helps to translate the frequency of 
                  the signal output from the 8051 to the desired frequency value.

                  Transducers basically contain quartz crystals which undergo deformation upon application of an AC wave and if the frequency of the applied AC wave coincides with the resonant frequency of the crystal ,the amplitude of the output mechanical disturbance(ultrasonic wave) is maximum .However tiny receptors embedded in our skin called mechanoreceptors</p>

              <h4>Introduction</h4>
              <p>Acoustic beam modeling of ultrasonic transducers consists of
              the determination of the acoustic pressure at a point or a region in
              front of the radiating surface. By the study and implementation of
              mathematical models, wave propagation is analyzed in
              nondestructive testing in order to optimize design parameters, such
              as geometry, focus depth, acoustic beam width and directivity. The
              acoustic beam generated is mainly dependent on the transducer
              geometry, the properties of the propagating medium and the
              excitation pulse form.
              The acoustic beam generated by an ultrasonic transducer can be
              modeled using the Rayleigh and Rayleigh-Sommerfeld equations
               which describe the acoustic propagation
              phenomenon in an integral form. From the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld
              equations, two methods for calculating the acoustic beam were
              developed. The first method is an exact solution for apertures with a
              simple geometrical shape and the second one is a numerical
              approximation that allows the analysis of arbitrarily shaped
              apertures.
              The most used method to calculate the exact solution is based on
              the temporal impulse response of the velocity potential. This method
              permits to calculate, in the time domain, the acoustic pressure
              induced in the medium by the transducer in an arbitrary spatial
              point. The method was initially proposed in acoustics by
              Stephanishen (Stephanishen, 1971) and, in order to obtain the exact
              solution of the impulse response, it is necessary to calculate
              complex integrals, only possible in the simplest geometry cases:
              circular pistons and hence we choose to use the circular piston
              transducer as the radiating source.</p>    
              <p>The acoustic beam generated depends on the emitted wave type
              . Excitation can be in continuous mode by using an
              electrical sine signal or in transient mode by means of an electrical
              pulse of short duration. Both excitation modes can be applied in the
              simulations of the acoustic beam by using the impulse response however for our project we decided to use continuous sinusoidal signals</p>  

              <p>Ultrasonic transducers can be either mono-element or multielement.
              The mono-element transducers have only one active
              element generally made of a piezoelectric material. The monoelement
              transducer is widely used in nondestructive testing and
              characterization of solids and liquids. That transducer has a fixed
              focus that has to be translated to generate an image. The plane
              piston transducer has a natural focus in a spatial point that is a
              function of its operation frequency and its radius. That natural focus
              can be modified by acoustic lens. The multi-element transducer is an
              array of active elements working independently. The main
              advantage of the ultrasonic arrays consists in the generation of an
              image avoiding the transducer translation. This is possible due to the
              capability of deflecting the acoustic beam and the dynamic
              modification of the focus. It is thus possible to avoid the complex
              mechatronic system required for controlling the transducer position. Therefore by using an array of transducers employed with phased array
              concepts we can bypass the complex electro-mechanical system which would otherwise be required to focus the point of convergence </p>
